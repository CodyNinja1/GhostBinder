# GhostFinder
Find and convert ghosts for when you need them.
- Find ghosts by map number
- Convert ghosts to replays (only for non-demo players).

Ghost conversion tutorial:
1. Find the ghost you want to convert.
2. Right-click on it.
3. Go to the new window.
4. If the EmptyReplay.Replay.Gbx file is not installed, then you can download it to continue.
5. If you want to make your own EmptyReplay.Replay.Gbx, there is one requirement needed for it: It must have exactly 1 ghost otherwise conversion fails.
6. Click "Convert to replay".
7. Go to the replay editor, and edit the EmptyReplay.
8. Save the replay as a new file.
9. Edit the new file to your liking, and congrats, you now have a replay!
